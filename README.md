The final model is in this notebook: [Final Model](https://github.com/Riyap30/Finetuning-with-LoRA/blob/main/notebooks/Final_model.ipynb)

The model has been trained on the AGNews dataset and tested on the same dataset. <br/>
Further, its predictions have been generated for the unlabeled dataset provided for this project, which are located here: [Output CSV file](https://github.com/Riyap30/Finetuning-with-LoRA/blob/main/results/inference_final.csv)

==> Performance:
* Validation Accuracy: 94.15%

The Jupyter Notebooks for all our models can be found inside `notebooks/`.
